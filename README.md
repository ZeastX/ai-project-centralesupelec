# ai-project-centralesupelec
This is the full ai project that we've done in centrale, 5 parts with each time a different focus.


namely machine learning which is quite self-explanatory. We explored the theory of machine learning
and its raw implementation without using a library.

search which was various implementation of search problems (tree/graph, with some constraints on 
the foods. 

We next did adversarial search where the objective was to factor in the behaviour of ghosts in 
order to develop strategies to win games.

then we did some reinforcement learning, with Q-learning, approximative Q-learning and even
Deep Q-learning. Really interesting.

last we did some combinatory logics and showed how most of the problems that we dealt with in
the various last parts of the project were in fact reductible to SAT problems.


I've had a lot of fun working on these project, i uploaded the entire projects just so you can 
download and run the code, but I didn't write most of this code, pacman implementation was already
done for example. I would say that in each project we had to modify 3 files which in general 
contained the agent that would make pacman move.

Nevertheless, I worked alone on this project and am very proud to have succeeded at implementing
each part alone, in time and with perfect results on almost every exercice.
